TrueOG Official Rules:

=-=-=-=-=-Banable Offenses:-=-=-=-=-=

Rule 1 - No Hateful Username Or Skins:
Do not join TrueOG with a racial or ableist slur in your name. Inappropriate usernames will be banned on-sight. Once you change your username back to something less malicious, you may appeal your ban at https://true-og.net/appeals

Rule 2 - No Exploiting Glitches:
Do not abuse your privileges, a bug or a glitch in order to gain an advantage over other players. This includes duping, lag machines, and block glitching. You may use the previously discovered season 1 map seed to find resources close to spawn, but no new seed hunting is allowed. TNT Duping is the only kind that is allowed.

Rule 3 - Be Accountable:
Don't fake evidence or evade punishments. Don't post links in chat that could get you or others in trouble with the law. Don‚Äôt attempt to trick any player into believing that you are someone you are not. If you are caught breaking the rules, own up to it.

Rule 4 - No Doxxing:
Do not reveal anyone‚Äôs private personal information without their consent.

Rule 5 - No Character Automation or Boosting.
Do not use baritone or any other mod that allows you to automate your character. TrueOG is open to sentient players only, not bots. Except our bots. Do not use alt accounts or friends to farm for gains in kills or other statistics.

Rule 6 - No Staff or Server Abuse:
Don't attempt to DDOS the server or otherwise attack TrueOG's infrastructure. Don't maliciously insult or threaten staff. They are volunteers who are doing their best.

Rule 7 - Use the Community Marketplace Responsibly:
Shops are mainly intended for selling, not storage. If the market is full, and your shop consists largely of non-sale blocks, you may be asked to change or remove your shop by a staff member. Here is an example of what not to do: https://true-og.net/bad-shop.png

=-=-=-=-=-Mutable Offenses:-=-=-=-=-=

Rule 8 - No Targeted Harassment or Bigotry:
TrueOG is not an anarchy server. While we are tolerant of swearing and trash talk, absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, ableism, racism or hate speech targeted at individuals will be tolerated.
(Witch hunting refers to the act of unfairly looking for and punishing people who are accused of having opinions that are believed to be dangerous or evil)

Rule 9 - No IRL Death Threats:
Do not wish death or physical harm upon another individual. If you are threatening to kill somebody in game, phrase it unambiguously, for example ‚ÄúI am going to kill you in Minecraft‚Äù.

Rule 10 - No Spamming:
Do not use excessive spam or caps in chat or you will be kicked. Repeated offenses will result in a mute. Bot spam is not allowed. You may only advertise your own pages or servers, and only once every 30 minutes.

Rule 11 - No Explicit Sexual Topics:
Do not discuss sexual topics or post pornography on the server. There are kids here. NSFW memes should be kept to #fun-katÔ∏±üêà, not posted in game.

Rule 12 - No Phishing or Scamming:
Don‚Äôt attempt to trick other members into revealing credentials. Posting malicious links will result in a permanent mute.

=-=-=-=-=-Discord Rules:-=-=-=-=-=

Rule 13 - Keep Voice Chat Legible:
Do not use extreme voice changers, loud noises, or music to intentionally annoy other players.
